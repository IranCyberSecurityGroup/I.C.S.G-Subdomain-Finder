This Script Finds The Subdomains Of A Domain That You Gave To It.

This Script Uses A Very Big Wordlist.

Wordlist Github Link : https://github.com/IranCyberSecurityGroup/I.C.S.G-Subdomain-Finder/blob/master/wordlist.txt

Or 

You Can Download It Via Mediafire : http://www.mediafire.com/download/0s7bfg9ehi6nyfp/wordlist.txt

It's Very Better That You Use It On A Vps Or SSH Root From Server Or From Server That You Backconnected.

Because It Will Be Very Powerful On Them.

You Can Run It By 2 Ways : 

1-perl file.pl site.com

2-perl file.pl

In Second Way Asks You The Site Address After Launching It.

But In First Way It Just Starts Finding After Launching It.

On A Server That You Backconnected Or A SSH Root From Server You "MUST" Run It By First Way.
